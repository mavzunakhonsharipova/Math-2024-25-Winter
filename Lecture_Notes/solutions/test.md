In mathematics, a **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. The elements within the matrix are called **entries** or **components**. A matrix is often used to represent data, solve systems of linear equations, and perform various mathematical operations.

Key characteristics of a matrix:
1. **Dimensions**: A matrix is defined by its number of rows (m) and columns (n), written as an **m × n matrix**.
   - Example: A matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is called a **2 × 3 matrix**.
   
2. **Matrix notation**: Matrices are typically represented by uppercase letters, and individual elements are denoted by a lowercase letter with two subscripts: the first for the row and the second for the column.
   - Example: The element at row $i$ and column $j$ of matrix $A$ is denoted as $A_{ij}$.

3. **Types of matrices**:
   - **Square matrix**: A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns (e.g., 3 × 3).
   - **Row matrix**: A matrix with only one row (e.g., 1 × n).
   - **Column matrix**: A matrix with only one column (e.g., m × 1).
   - **Zero matrix**: A matrix where all elements are zero.
   - **Identity matrix**: A square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

4. **Matrix Operations**:
   - **Addition**: Matrices can be added if they have the same dimensions.
   - **Multiplication**: Matrices can be multiplied under certain conditions (the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix).
   - **Transposition**: A matrix can be transposed by swapping its rows and columns.

5. **Applications**:
   - **Systems of linear equations**: Matrices can be used to represent and solve systems of equations.
   - **Transformations in computer graphics**: Matrices are used in operations like scaling, rotating, and translating objects.
   - **Data science and machine learning**: Matrices are used to represent and manipulate data in algorithms and computations.

An example of a 2 × 2 matrix is:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In this case, the matrix \(A\) has two rows and two columns, with the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.
